        <p>Hi there! My name is Gabrielle Lowe. I was born in Ottawa, Ontario on August 5<sup>th</sup> 1999, making my zodiac a Leo.
        I firstly became interested in media design, specifically in photography and videography during my years in high school however,
        quickly lost touch of this love as I was heavily involved in other arts. From the early age of five, I quickly discovered I had a passion 
        for the art of dance after being enrolled in my first ballet class. After dancing for nearly thirteen years, I decided to follow my dreams
        of pursuing a dance career and got a ccepted into the Ryerson University School of Performance dance program in 2017.</p>
        <p>Now, being a recent graduate of the program, obtaining my <abbr title="Bachelor of Fine Arts">BFA</abbr> in 2021, I was unsure of where my career was 
        going to take me next, especially during a global pandemic. During those times, I found myself reconnecting with my old passion for videography
        and ended up creating multiple short dance films of my own for various virtual dance festivals. </p>
        <p>Eventually, I decided that I wanted to further my knowledge of videography and wanted to take it more seriously, hence my decision for enrolling
        into this program. I decided that Interactive Media Design would be the right program for me as I could take this passion for creating films and possibly 
        turn it into a sustainable career path post-graduation. Ultimately, finding a career that could combine both my passion for dance and videography would be
        a dream. </p>
